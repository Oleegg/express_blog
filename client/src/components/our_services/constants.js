    text: "We do simple bicycle repairs right away. If the technician is busy or the work is complex or time-consuming, the bicycle is accepted for repair and remains in the bicycle workshop. The duration of bicycle repair is 1-2 days. If the service is extremely busy, the deadline is negotiated with the customer.",

    text: "Our bicycle workshop provides maintenance services for bicycles of all brands and models. The costs and prices for servicing your bike depend on what kind of bike you have and what condition it is in. If the bike is serviced quite often, then its “maintenance” and tuning will be much cheaper for you and will actually become a prevention rather than a cure.",

    text: "People buy different bikes and we provide assembly services for any bike they just bought. If necessary, we can come to your home for assembly. The cost of assembling and tuning the bike, and how long it will take, will depend on the type of bicycle, its “complexity”, “sophistication”.",

    text: "Our bicycle workshop can offer services to improve and modify your bicycle. You can improve almost any part of a bicycle and make it more efficient. On the other hand, sometimes it is even more advisable to look at more expensive used bicycle models, but of a higher class, and think about what will be cheaper: buy a carbon bicycle assembled second-hand or modify your own bicycle. Each has its own tasks and goals, contact us and we will help you achieve them.",
